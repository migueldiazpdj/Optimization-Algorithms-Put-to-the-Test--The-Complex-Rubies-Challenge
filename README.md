# Optimization-Algorithms-Put-to-the-Test--The-Complex-Rubies-Challenge
How does the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm perform on a challenging, real-world problem? 🐜✨ We apply ACO to the complex Rubies function—a multi-modal optimization problem with non-linear interactions and constraints.
After testing ACO, we also apply other optimization methods, including Tabu Search, Hill Climbing, and Evolutionary Algorithms, to compare their performance. Which algorithm finds the best solution? How do their strategies differ? Watch the video to see how these methods perform and which one comes out on top! 🚀

# 🚀 Optimization Algorithm Comparison
